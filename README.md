# Soundscape-Narrative
Composing Digital Media Project1

This is a preview for the soundscape narrative that I am working on. Admittedly, I am a little behind because I have been focusing a majority of my time on recording sounds. 
Regardless, I posted my preview here. I began to experiment with the idea of implementing voiceovers into the project. These voiceovers will offer context to the following sounds as well as provide some background
information on my brother. The preview, linked below, has an introductory voiceover along with some slight fade in effects. This introduction is then followed by a raw recording of my brother. In the future, I plan 
to add more voiceovers. I plan on having four sections in this project: (1) Kai's morning routine (2) Kai's routine while just sitting around (3) Kai's routine in the car (4) Kai's nightime routine. Each section will have a
complementary voice over in addition to the introductory voice over.
